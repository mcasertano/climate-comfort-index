The app is hosted at https://mcasertano.pythonanywhere.com/.

The folder "app_src" has all code that was put into the app.

In addition, "create_df.ipynb" is given separately. This file creates "full_df.csv", the dataframe used in the app. It does so by downloading county climate data from https://amcneil36.github.io/programs/CountyStats/CountyStats.csv and county geometry data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/The-Python-Graph-Gallery/master/static/data/US-counties.geojson and doing a lot of merging, cleaning, etc.

Finally:
Code Archive - Sep 2024 is a folder that contains all other code that was written at some point in this project.

The "Code_In_App" has the files that were put in the app. Should be fully up-to-date or close.

Archive contains some past working versions. Unnecessary code contains old code when I did a webscraping approach.

Preferences.json is from before when I fed JSON instead of HTML

ComfortScore.py is the comfort function in its own file, I believe fully up to date.

Real-Create_DF is the most up to date code to creating the dataframe that the actual code and app use from the given data frame - lots of cleaning etc. Produces full_df.csv. That csv contains all cleaned weather data and corresponding geometry for each county.

Real-Plot_Comfort is the code for plotting locally, either is fully up to date or very close in terms of matching the app.
